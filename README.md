<h2 align="center">MathGen V0.0.1</h2>

- cd src
- make
- use sh cleanup.sh to for cleanup (deletes the *.o *.txt and the mathGen executable)

### TODO:
- [x] Make a test file
- [ ] Do some makefile research (I want to make a include file for all the other .cpp and .h files, so it's just the Makefile, cleanup.sh, main.cpp and the executable in the src folder.)
- [x] Make a menu
  - [x] Maybe add some color to the menu
- [ ] Write a random plus assignments to the console.
- [ ] Write the plus assignments down to 2 separate files. (A student file (without the answers) and a teacher file (with the same questions but with the answers))
  - [ ] Maybe ad it like this:
    ```
    1)                                - this is the assignment number
    123 + 123                         - this is the assignment



    Might also be able to do

       123                            - WITH UNDERLINE
    +  123
    ```
- [ ] Maybe make some others like - * / ^
